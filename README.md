Inkyphat_NFTperp is a Python script that fetches cryptocurrency data from the nftperp.xyz API and displays it on an InkyPHAT black display hat for Raspberry Pi. The script displays the mark price and index price for Milady and a specific wallet's Profit and Loss percentage. You can add more API calls from nftperp from [here](https://nftperp.readme.io/reference/mark-price).

4. Run the script makling sure you are in the right directory:

```
python3 perpmilady.py
```

5. Setup Cron to run the script every x minutes:

```
crontab -e
```

6. Add the following line to your crontab file, replacing "x" with the number of minutes you want to wait between updates.
You will need to also input the working directory of the scrip and the username:

```
* * * * * cd <enter-working-directory> && /usr/bin/python3.9 perpmilady2.py >> /home/<enter-username>/cron.log 2>&1

```
To get the crontask to work you need to make sure all the directory information is correct. 
the last part of the code will create a log for you to troubleshoot whats happening on your main directory.

This is what it should look like once run:
